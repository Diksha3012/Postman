                              3.go back to accessing api using variable>select method request like get http://localhost:3000/users and change it to {{url}}/users and                                                                                                                                                                   
                                 then send.
                              4. We can access each request method of creating own api collection with this method.
                                 if we have to do post/put we always have to use request payload and than we can run from runner.
